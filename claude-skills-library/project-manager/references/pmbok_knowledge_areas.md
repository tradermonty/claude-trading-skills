  - Activity ID and name
  - Description
  - Predecessor activities
  - Successor activities
  - Logical relationships
  - Leads and lags
  - Resource requirements
  - Constraints and assumptions
  - Responsible person

### Sequence Activities
- **Dependency Types:**
  - Finish-to-Start (FS): Most common
  - Finish-to-Finish (FF)
  - Start-to-Start (SS)
  - Start-to-Finish (SF): Rarely used

- **Dependency Categories:**
  - Mandatory (hard logic): Inherent in nature of work
  - Discretionary (soft logic): Based on best practices
  - External: Outside project control
  - Internal: Within project control

- **Leads and Lags:**
  - Lead: Acceleration, start successor before predecessor finishes
  - Lag: Delay, wait time between activities

### Estimate Activity Durations
- **Estimation Techniques:**
  - Analogous Estimating: Use historical data from similar activities
  - Parametric Estimating: Statistical relationship (e.g., lines of code per day)
  - Three-Point Estimating: (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
  - Bottom-Up Estimating: Aggregate estimates from work package level
  - Expert Judgment
  - Reserve Analysis: Contingency reserves for known-unknowns

- **Duration vs Effort:**
  - Duration: Calendar time from start to finish
  - Effort: Work hours required
  - Formula: Duration = Effort / (Resources × Efficiency)

### Develop Schedule
- **Schedule Development Techniques:**

**Critical Path Method (CPM):**
- Identifies longest path through network
- Determines minimum project duration
- Float/Slack = Late Start - Early Start (or Late Finish - Early Finish)
- Zero float = critical activity
- Negative float = behind schedule
- Positive float = cushion available

**Critical Chain Method:**
- Considers resource limitations
- Buffers protect project completion date
- Project buffer: End of critical chain
- Feeding buffers: Where non-critical chains feed critical chain

**Resource Optimization:**
- Resource Leveling: Adjust start/finish dates based on resource constraints (may extend project duration)
- Resource Smoothing: Adjust within float, doesn't change critical path

**Schedule Compression:**
- Crashing: Add resources to critical path activities (increases cost)
- Fast Tracking: Perform activities in parallel (increases risk)

### Schedule Baseline
- Approved version of schedule model
- Used for comparison against actual performance
- Can only be changed through formal change control

### Control Schedule
- **Earned Value Management (EVM) Metrics:**
  - PV (Planned Value): Budgeted cost of work scheduled
  - EV (Earned Value): Budgeted cost of work performed
  - AC (Actual Cost): Actual cost of work performed
  - SV (Schedule Variance) = EV - PV
    - Negative = Behind schedule
    - Positive = Ahead of schedule
  - SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV
    - < 1.0 = Behind schedule
    - = 1.0 = On schedule
    - > 1.0 = Ahead of schedule

- **Forecasting:**
  - EAC (Estimate at Completion)
  - ETC (Estimate to Complete)
  - TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index)

**Best Practices:**
- Use project management software for complex schedules
- Identify critical path early and monitor closely
- Build in contingency reserves (5-10% typical)
- Update schedule regularly (weekly for active projects)
- Communicate schedule changes immediately
- Focus on critical and near-critical activities
- Consider resource availability realistically

**Core Activities:**

### Estimate Costs
- **Cost Types:**
  - Direct Costs: Attributable directly to project (labor, materials, equipment)
  - Indirect Costs: Overhead, facilities, administrative (allocated across projects)
  - Fixed Costs: Constant regardless of production (lease, salary)
  - Variable Costs: Change with volume of production (raw materials, utilities)
  - Sunk Costs: Already spent, should not influence future decisions

- **Estimation Techniques:**
  - Analogous Estimating: Based on similar past projects (±25-75% accuracy)
  - Parametric Estimating: Statistical models (e.g., $X per square foot)
  - Bottom-Up Estimating: Sum of individual work package estimates (±5-10% accuracy)
  - Three-Point Estimating: (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
  - Reserve Analysis:
    - Contingency reserves: Known-unknowns (part of cost baseline, requires PM approval)
    - Management reserves: Unknown-unknowns (outside baseline, requires senior management approval)

- **Cost Estimate Components:**
  - Labor costs (rate × hours)
  - Material costs
  - Equipment costs
  - Subcontractor costs
  - Travel expenses
  - Training costs
  - Contingency reserves
  - Indirect costs/overhead

### Determine Budget
- **Cost Aggregation:**

  - Add control account costs
  - Add contingency reserves
  - Result: Cost baseline

- **Cost Baseline:**
  - Time-phased budget
  - Authorized budget excluding management reserves
  - S-curve typically (cumulative cost over time)
  - Used for performance measurement

- **Project Budget:**
  - Cost baseline + management reserves
  - Total funding required

### Control Costs
- **Earned Value Management (EVM):**

**Key Metrics:**
- PV (Planned Value): What should have been spent
- EV (Earned Value): Value of work actually completed
- AC (Actual Cost): What was actually spent

**Variance Analysis:**
- CV (Cost Variance) = EV - AC
  - Negative = Over budget
  - Positive = Under budget
- CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC
  - < 1.0 = Over budget
  - = 1.0 = On budget
  - > 1.0 = Under budget

**Forecasting:**
- EAC (Estimate at Completion) = BAC / CPI (typical formula)
- ETC (Estimate to Complete) = EAC - AC
- VAC (Variance at Completion) = BAC - EAC
- TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
  - Efficiency needed to complete on budget

**Best Practices:**
- Establish cost baseline early
- Track actual costs weekly
- Calculate EVM metrics regularly
- Forecast EAC continuously
- Investigate variances > 10%
- Use parametric models for similar activities
- Build appropriate contingency (10-20% typical for IT projects)
- Consider total cost of ownership (TCO), not just project costs

  - Total EMV = $5K

### Plan Risk Responses
- **Strategies for Negative Risks (Threats):**
  1. **Avoid:** Eliminate threat by changing project plan
  2. **Mitigate:** Reduce probability or impact
  3. **Transfer:** Shift impact to third party (insurance, warranties, guarantees, outsourcing)
  4. **Accept:** Acknowledge risk, don't take action unless it occurs
     - Passive: Do nothing
     - Active: Establish contingency reserve

- **Strategies for Positive Risks (Opportunities):**
  1. **Exploit:** Ensure opportunity occurs
  2. **Enhance:** Increase probability or impact
  3. **Share:** Allocate ownership to third party best able to capture benefit
  4. **Accept:** Willing to take advantage if it occurs but don't actively pursue

- **Contingency Plans:** Pre-planned responses if risk event occurs
- **Fallback Plans:** Backup plans if primary response doesn't work
- **Workarounds:** Unplanned responses to unanticipated risks

### Monitor Risks
- **Risk Monitoring Activities:**
  - Track identified risks
  - Monitor residual risks
  - Identify new risks
  - Execute risk response plans

## Integration Across Knowledge Areas

**Key Principle:** All knowledge areas are interconnected. Effective project management requires balancing competing demands across all areas.

### Common Integration Points:
- **Scope-Schedule-Cost (Triple Constraint):** Changes in one affect others
- **Quality-Cost:** Quality improvements may increase cost
- **Risk-Schedule:** Aggressive schedules increase risk
- **Resources-Schedule:** Limited resources extend duration
- **Stakeholders-Communications:** Stakeholder needs drive communication plan
- **Procurement-Risk:** External dependencies add risk

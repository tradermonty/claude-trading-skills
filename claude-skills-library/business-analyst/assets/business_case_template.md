Total Benefits (3 years) = ¥[Amount]
Total Costs (3 years) = ¥[Amount]
Net Benefit = ¥[Amount]

ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100%
ROI = [X]%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Initial Investment = ¥[Amount]
Annual Net Benefit = ¥[Amount]

Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Benefit
Payback Period = [X] years [Y] months
```

**Net Present Value (NPV):**
```
Discount Rate = 10%

Year 0: -¥[Amount]
Year 1: ¥[Amount] / 1.10 = ¥[PV]
Year 2: ¥[Amount] / 1.21 = ¥[PV]
Year 3: ¥[Amount] / 1.331 = ¥[PV]

NPV = ¥[Total]
```

**Interpretation:**

## 10. Recommendation

### 10.1 Decision

**Recommendation:** ☑ Approve  ☐ Reject  ☐ Defer

**Rationale:** [2-3 paragraphs explaining the recommendation based on financial analysis, strategic alignment, and risk assessment]

**Example:**
"Based on the financial analysis, this project delivers a positive NPV of ¥15M over 3 years with a payback period of 2.1 years and ROI of 120%. These metrics exceed our investment hurdle rates of 10% ROI and 3-year payback. The project strongly aligns with our strategic goal of achieving 25% revenue growth by enabling us to double our order processing capacity. While there are risks related to change management and implementation, these are manageable with appropriate mitigation strategies and are outweighed by the significant business benefits. We recommend proceeding with Option 1: Automated Order Processing System."

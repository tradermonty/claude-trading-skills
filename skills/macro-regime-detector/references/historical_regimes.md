# Historical Regime Examples

Reference cases for the 5 regime classifications. Use these to contextualize current readings and identify historical parallels.

## Concentration Regimes

### 2023-2024: Magnificent Seven Dominance

- **RSP/SPY**: Declined from ~0.32 to ~0.29, a multi-year low
- **IWM/SPY**: Persistent underperformance of small-caps
- **Credit**: Stable to easing (HYG/LQD steady)
- **Characteristics**: Top 7 stocks drove ~60% of S&P 500 returns
- **Duration**: ~18 months
- **Resolution**: Early signs of broadening in late 2024 (RSP/SPY bottoming)
- **Portfolio posture**: Mega-cap growth overweight was the only winning strategy

### 2019-2020 (Pre-COVID): FAANG+ Concentration

- **RSP/SPY**: Gradual decline through 2019
- **IWM/SPY**: Small-cap underperformance
- **Ended**: Abruptly with COVID crash (exogenous shock)

## Broadening Regimes

### 2003-2004: Post-Dot-Com Recovery

- **RSP/SPY**: Rose significantly as value and small-caps recovered
- **IWM/SPY**: Strong small-cap outperformance
- **Credit**: HYG/LQD rising as credit conditions eased
- **Yield curve**: Steep (accommodative Fed)
- **Duration**: ~24 months
- **Portfolio posture**: Small-cap value, equal-weight strategies outperformed

### 2016-2017: Post-Election Broadening

- **RSP/SPY**: Rose as cyclicals and financials rallied
- **IWM/SPY**: Small-cap surge post-election
- **Credit**: Stable to improving
- **XLY/XLP**: Strong cyclical outperformance
- **Duration**: ~12 months
- **Portfolio posture**: Cyclicals, financials, small-cap growth

## Contraction Regimes

### 2007-2009: Global Financial Crisis

- **Credit**: HYG/LQD collapsed (credit freeze)
- **XLY/XLP**: Extreme defensive rotation
- **SPY/TLT**: Sharp decline as bonds rallied
- **Yield curve**: Initially inverted, then steepened dramatically
- **Duration**: ~18 months (bear phase)
- **Portfolio posture**: Cash, Treasuries, defensive sectors

### 2020 Q1: COVID Crash

- **Credit**: HYG/LQD dropped sharply in March
- **XLY/XLP**: Rapid defensive rotation
- **SPY/TLT**: Crashed as equities sold off
- **Duration**: ~6 weeks (shortest contraction on record)
- **Resolution**: Massive fiscal/monetary response triggered V-shaped recovery
- **Lesson**: Not all contractions are prolonged; policy response matters

## Inflationary Regimes

### 2022: Inflation Shock

- **Stock-bond correlation**: Turned positive (both fell together)
- **SPY/TLT**: Both declined simultaneously
- **10Y-2Y**: Deep inversion (most inverted since 1980s)
- **Yield curve**: Aggressive flattening then inversion
- **Duration**: ~12 months
- **Portfolio posture**: Energy, commodities, real assets, short-duration bonds
- **Key characteristic**: Traditional 60/40 portfolio failed as bonds didn't hedge

### 1970s Stagflation (Historical Reference)

- **Stock-bond correlation**: Persistently positive
- **Commodities**: Outperformed financial assets
- **Duration**: Extended (years)
- **Modern parallel**: 2022 showed echoes but resolved faster

## Transitional Regimes

### 2024 Q4 - 2025 Q1: Current Example

- **RSP/SPY**: Near historical lows (~0.297) but showing early bottoming signs
- **IWM/SPY**: Mixed signals, brief outperformance then reversal
- **Credit**: Stable (HYG/LQD holding)
- **Yield curve**: Normalizing from inversion
- **XLY/XLP**: Choppy, no clear direction
- **Interpretation**: Multiple indicators shifting but no clear new regime yet
- **Portfolio posture**: Maintain diversification, gradual position adjustments

### 2018: Failed Broadening

- **RSP/SPY**: Brief broadening attempt in early 2018
- **Credit**: Tightened in Q4 2018 (HYG selloff)
- **Resolution**: Fed pivot in early 2019 prevented full contraction
- **Lesson**: Transitional periods can resolve in any direction

## Regime Transition Patterns

### Common Sequences

1. **Concentration → Broadening**: Usually requires catalyst (Fed easing, fiscal stimulus, valuation compression in leaders)

2. **Broadening → Contraction**: Credit tightening is the typical trigger. Watch HYG/LQD for early warning.

3. **Contraction → Broadening**: Policy response (rate cuts, QE) → credit easing → small-cap recovery

4. **Any → Inflationary**: Positive stock-bond correlation is the key signal. Can emerge from either broadening or contraction.

### Transition Timing

- Average regime duration: 12-24 months
- Transition phase: Typically 3-6 months of ambiguous signals
- Early signals appear 2-4 months before consensus recognition
- MA crossovers (6M vs 12M) confirm after the fact but provide low false-positive rate

### False Signals

- 2018 Q1: Broadening signal reversed by Q4 (trade war + Fed tightening)
- 2015: Multiple signals of contraction that never fully materialized
- Lesson: Require 3+ months of sustained signals before high-conviction repositioning

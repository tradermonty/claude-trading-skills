# VCP Methodology - Minervini's Volatility Contraction Pattern

## Overview

The Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) was developed by Mark Minervini, two-time U.S. Investing Championship winner. It identifies stocks in Stage 2 uptrends that are forming progressively tighter consolidation patterns before a potential breakout.

## Stage Analysis Foundation

### The 4 Stages (Stan Weinstein / Minervini)

1. **Stage 1 - Accumulation/Basing:** Stock trades sideways after a decline. Smart money accumulates.
2. **Stage 2 - Advancing/Uptrend:** Stock is in a confirmed uptrend. This is where VCPs form. **The only stage to buy.**
3. **Stage 3 - Distribution/Topping:** Stock stalls after an advance. Smart money distributes.
4. **Stage 4 - Declining/Downtrend:** Stock is in a confirmed downtrend. Avoid or short.

### Minervini's 7-Point Trend Template (Stage 2 Confirmation)

A stock MUST pass all (or nearly all) of these criteria to be in a confirmed Stage 2:

| # | Criterion | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Price > 150-day SMA AND Price > 200-day SMA | Above major trend lines |
| 2 | 150-day SMA > 200-day SMA | Shorter MA above longer (bullish alignment) |
| 3 | 200-day SMA trending up for 22+ trading days | Long-term trend is up |
| 4 | Price > 50-day SMA | Above intermediate trend line |
| 5 | Price at least 25% above 52-week low | Sufficient distance from lows |
| 6 | Price within 25% of 52-week high | Not in a deep correction |
| 7 | Relative Strength rating > 70 | Outperforming most stocks |

**Pass threshold:** 6 of 7 criteria (score >= 85) to proceed to VCP detection.

## VCP Pattern Mechanics

### What is a VCP?

A VCP occurs when a stock in a Stage 2 uptrend pulls back and then rallies, but each successive pullback is **shallower** (less volatile) than the previous one. This "volatility contraction" signals that:

1. Selling pressure is being absorbed
2. Remaining sellers are being exhausted
3. Supply is drying up
4. A breakout becomes more probable

### Contraction Structure

```
        H1 (Highest swing high)
       / \
      /   \  T1 (First contraction: deepest)
     /     \
    /       L1
   /       / \
  /       /   \ T2 (Second contraction: tighter)
         H2    \
          \    L2
           \  / \
            \/   \ T3 (Third contraction: tightest)
            H3    L3
             \   /
              \ /  ← PIVOT POINT (buy here on volume)
               P
```

### Contraction Rules

- **T1 (first correction):** 8-35% depth for S&P 500 large-caps (up to 50% for small-caps)
- **T2:** Must be at least 25% tighter than T1 (ratio <= 0.75)
- **T3:** Must be at least 25% tighter than T2 (if present)
- **T4:** Extremely tight, often < 5% (rare, very bullish)
- **Minimum:** 2 contractions required
- **Ideal:** 3-4 contractions with progressive tightening
- **Duration:** 15-325 trading days for the complete pattern

### Pivot Point

The **pivot** is the high of the last contraction. This is the buy point:

- Buy when price moves above the pivot on volume 1.5x+ above the 50-day average
- Place stop-loss 1-2% below the last contraction low
- Risk per trade should be 5-8% from entry to stop

### Volume Signature

Ideal volume behavior during a VCP:

1. **During corrections:** Volume should decrease (sellers exhausting)
2. **Near the pivot:** Volume should "dry up" (extremely low, calm before the storm)
3. **On breakout:** Volume should surge to 1.5-2x the 50-day average

**Dry-up ratio** = Average volume (last 10 bars near pivot) / 50-day average volume
- < 0.30: Exceptional (textbook)
- 0.30-0.50: Strong
- 0.50-0.70: Adequate
- \> 0.70: Weak (caution)

## Historical VCP Examples

### Classic 3-Contraction VCP
- T1: 20% pullback over 6 weeks
- T2: 12% pullback over 3 weeks (40% tighter)
- T3: 5% pullback over 2 weeks (58% tighter)
- Breakout on 2x volume → 50%+ advance

### Tight 2-Contraction VCP (Large-Cap)
- T1: 12% pullback over 4 weeks
- T2: 5% pullback over 2 weeks (58% tighter)
- Breakout on 1.8x volume → 25-30% advance

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Buying before the pivot:** Wait for the breakout, not the setup
2. **Ignoring volume:** A breakout without volume often fails
3. **Wide stops:** Keep stops tight (below last contraction low)
4. **Wrong stage:** VCPs only work in Stage 2; verify with Trend Template first
5. **Deep T1:** If T1 > 35% for large-caps, the pattern is less reliable
6. **Expanding contractions:** If T2 > T1, it's NOT a VCP

## Position Sizing by VCP Quality

| Rating | Position Size | Risk Budget |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Textbook (90+) | 1.5-2x normal | Full |
| Strong (80-89) | 1x normal | Full |
| Good (70-79) | 0.75x normal | Standard |
| Developing (60-69) | Wait/Watch | Reduced |

# Trade Rules and Reporting

Steps 6 to 8 detail, moved verbatim from `SKILL.md`.

## Step 6 detail: Entry and Exit Conditions

**Entry Conditions:**

**Conservative Approach (Z ≥ ±2.0):**
```
LONG Signal:
- Z-score < -2.0 (spread 2+ std devs below mean)
- Spread is mean-reverting (cointegration p < 0.05)
- Half-life < 60 days
→ Action: Buy Stock A, Short Stock B (hedge ratio = beta)

SHORT Signal:
- Z-score > +2.0 (spread 2+ std devs above mean)
- Spread is mean-reverting (cointegration p < 0.05)
- Half-life < 60 days
→ Action: Short Stock A, Buy Stock B (hedge ratio = beta)
```

**Aggressive Approach (Z ≥ ±1.5):**
- Lower threshold for more frequent trades
- Higher win rate but smaller avg profit per trade
- Requires tighter risk management

**Exit Conditions:**

**Primary Exit: Mean Reversion (Z = 0)**
```
Exit when spread returns to mean (z-score crosses 0)
→ Close both legs simultaneously
```

**Secondary Exit: Partial Profit Take**
```
Exit 50% when z-score reaches ±1.0
Exit remaining 50% at z-score = 0
```

**Stop Loss:**
```
Exit if z-score extends beyond ±3.0 (extreme divergence)
Risk: Possible structural break in relationship
```

**Time-Based Exit:**
```
Exit after 90 days if no mean-reversion
Prevents holding broken pairs indefinitely
```

## Step 7 detail: Position Sizing and Risk Management

**Market Neutral Sizing:**

For a pair (Stock A, Stock B) with beta = β:

**Equal Dollar Exposure:**
```
If portfolio size = $10,000 allocated to this pair:
- Long $5,000 of Stock A
- Short $5,000 × β of Stock B

Example (β = 1.2):
- Long $5,000 Stock A
- Short $6,000 Stock B
→ Market neutral, beta = 0
```

**Position Sizing Considerations:**
- Total pair allocation: 10-20% of portfolio per pair
- Maximum pairs: 5-8 active pairs for diversification
- Correlation across pairs: Avoid highly correlated pairs

**Risk Metrics:**
- Maximum loss per pair: 2-3% of total portfolio
- Stop loss trigger: Z-score > ±3.0 or -5% loss on spread
- Portfolio-level risk: Sum of all pair risks ≤ 10%

"""
Market Breadth Analyzer - Composite Scoring Engine

Combines 6 component scores into a weighted composite (0-100).
Score direction: 100 = Healthy, 0 = Critical (breadth is a health indicator).

Component Weights:
1. Current Breadth Level & Trend:  25%
2. 8MA vs 200MA Crossover:        20%
3. Peak/Trough Cycle Position:    20%
4. Bearish Signal Status:         15%
5. Historical Percentile:         10%
6. S&P 500 vs Breadth Divergence: 10%
Total: 100%

When a component has data_available=False, its weight is proportionally
redistributed among the remaining available components.

Health Zone Mapping (100 = Healthy):
  80-100: Strong    - Full equity exposure
  60-79:  Healthy   - Normal operations
  40-59:  Neutral   - Selective positioning
  20-39:  Weakening - Profit-taking, raise cash
  0-19:   Critical  - Capital preservation

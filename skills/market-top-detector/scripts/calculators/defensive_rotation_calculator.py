Component 3: Defensive Sector Rotation (Weight: 15%)

Compares defensive ETF performance vs offensive/growth ETF performance
using multi-period weighted analysis: 10d(0.2) + 20d(0.5) + 40d(0.3).

Defensive: XLU, XLP, XLV, VNQ
Offensive:  XLK, XLC, XLY, QQQ

Scoring (defensive_return - offensive_return):
  +5.0% or more -> 100 (Strong rotation into defensives)
  +3.0% or more -> 80
  +1.5% or more -> 60
  +0.5% or more -> 40
  +0.0% or more -> 20
  Negative       ->  0 (Growth leading = healthy)

Multi-period confirmation:
  All periods defensive -> "confirmed" (max 100)
  Some periods only     -> "unconfirmed" (capped at 80)

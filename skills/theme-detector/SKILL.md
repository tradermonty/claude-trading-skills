name: theme-detector
description: "Detect and analyze trending market themes across sectors, generate theme lifecycle reports, and track sector momentum and rotation patterns. Use when user asks about current market themes, trending sectors, sector rotation, thematic investing, what themes are hot or cold, or wants to identify bullish and bearish market narratives with lifecycle analysis."

# Theme Detector

## Overview

This skill detects and ranks trending market themes by analyzing cross-sector momentum, volume, and breadth signals. It identifies both bullish and bearish themes, assesses lifecycle maturity (Emerging/Accelerating/Trending/Mature/Exhausting), and provides a confidence score combining quantitative data with narrative analysis. Operates in dual mode: FINVIZ Elite (fast, full coverage) or public scraping (free, rate-limited). See `references/theme_detection_methodology.md` for the full 3-Dimensional Scoring Model (Theme Heat, Lifecycle Maturity, Confidence).

## When to Use This Skill

**Triggers:** User asks about trending market themes, hot/cold sectors, sector rotation, thematic investing opportunities, bullish/bearish narratives, crowded vs. emerging trades, or theme lifecycle status (e.g., "Is AI still a strong theme?").

**When NOT to Use:**
- Individual stock analysis (use us-stock-analysis)
- Sector deep-dive with chart reading (use sector-analyst)
- Portfolio rebalancing (use portfolio-manager)
- Dividend/income investing (use value-dividend-screener)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Requirements

Check for required API keys and dependencies:

```bash
# Check for FINVIZ Elite API key (optional but recommended)
echo $FINVIZ_API_KEY

# Check for FMP API key (optional, used for valuation metrics)
echo $FMP_API_KEY
```

**Requirements:**
- **Python 3.7+** with `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `yfinance`
- **FINVIZ Elite API key** (recommended for full industry coverage and speed)
- **FMP API key** (optional, for P/E ratio valuation data)
- Without FINVIZ Elite, the skill uses public FINVIZ scraping (limited to ~20 stocks per industry, slower rate limits)

**Optional dependencies:**
- `finvizfinance` (for FINVIZ Elite mode)
- `PyYAML` (for `--themes-config` custom themes)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas numpy yfinance
```

### Step 2: Execute Theme Detection Script

Run the main detection script:

```bash
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Script Options:**
```bash
# Full run (public FINVIZ mode, no API key required)
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --output-dir reports/

# With FINVIZ Elite API key
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --finviz-api-key $FINVIZ_API_KEY \
  --output-dir reports/

# With FMP API key for enhanced stock data
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --fmp-api-key $FMP_API_KEY \
  --output-dir reports/

# Custom limits
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --max-themes 5 \
  --max-stocks-per-theme 10 \
  --output-dir reports/

# Explicit FINVIZ mode
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --finviz-mode public \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Expected Execution Time:**
- FINVIZ Elite mode: ~2-3 minutes (14+ themes)
- Public FINVIZ mode: ~5-8 minutes (rate-limited scraping)

### Step 3: Read and Parse Detection Results

The script generates two output files:
- `theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured data for programmatic use
- `theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` - Human-readable report

Read the JSON output to understand quantitative results:

```bash
# Find the latest report
ls -lt reports/theme_detector_*.json | head -1

# Read the JSON output
cat reports/theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Step 4: Perform Narrative Confirmation via WebSearch

For the top 5 themes (by Theme Heat score), execute WebSearch queries to confirm narrative strength:

**Search Pattern:**
```
"[theme name] stocks market [current month] [current year]"
"[theme name] sector momentum [current month] [current year]"
```

**Evaluate narrative signals:**
- **Strong narrative**: Multiple major outlets covering the theme, analyst upgrades, policy catalysts
- **Moderate narrative**: Some coverage, mixed sentiment, no clear catalyst
- **Weak narrative**: Little coverage, or predominantly contrarian/skeptical tone

Update Confidence levels based on findings:
- Quantitative High + Narrative Strong = **High** confidence
- Quantitative High + Narrative Weak = **Medium** confidence (possible momentum divergence)
- Quantitative Low + Narrative Strong = **Medium** confidence (narrative may lead price)
- Quantitative Low + Narrative Weak = **Low** confidence

### Step 5: Analyze Results and Provide Recommendations

Cross-reference detection results with knowledge bases:

**Reference Documents to Consult:**
1. `references/cross_sector_themes.md` - Theme definitions and constituent industries
2. `references/thematic_etf_catalog.md` - ETF exposure options by theme
3. `references/theme_detection_methodology.md` - Scoring model details
4. `references/finviz_industry_codes.md` - Industry classification reference

**Analysis Framework:**

For **Hot Bullish Themes** (Heat >= 70, Direction = Bullish):
- Identify lifecycle stage (Emerging = opportunity, Mature/Exhausting = caution)
- List top-performing industries within the theme
- Recommend proxy ETFs for exposure
- Flag if ETF proliferation is high (crowded trade warning)

For **Hot Bearish Themes** (Heat >= 70, Direction = Bearish):
- Identify industries under pressure
- Assess if bearish momentum is accelerating or decelerating
- Recommend hedging strategies or sectors to avoid
- Note potential mean-reversion opportunities if lifecycle is Mature/Exhausting

For **Emerging Themes** (Heat 40-69, Lifecycle = Emerging):
- These may represent early rotation signals
- Recommend monitoring with watchlist
- Identify catalyst events that could accelerate the theme

For **Exhausted Themes** (Heat >= 60, Lifecycle = Exhausting):
- Warn about crowded trade risk
- High ETF count confirms excessive retail participation
- Consider contrarian positioning or reducing exposure

### Step 6: Generate Final Report

Present the final report to the user using the report template structure:

```markdown

## Important Notes

### FINVIZ Mode Differences

| Feature | Elite Mode | Public Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Industry coverage | All ~145 industries | All ~145 industries |
| Stocks per industry | Full universe | ~20 stocks (page 1) |
| Rate limiting | 0.5s between requests | 2.0s between requests |
| Data freshness | Real-time | 15-min delayed |
| API key required | Yes ($39.50/mo) | No |
| Execution time | ~2-3 minutes | ~5-8 minutes |

### Direction Detection Logic

Theme direction is determined by majority vote of constituent industries' relative rank:

1. **Industry ranking**: All ~145 industries are ranked by multi-timeframe momentum score
2. **Rank-based direction**: Industries in the top half of the ranked list are classified as "bullish"; bottom half as "bearish"
3. **Theme majority vote**: `_majority_direction()` counts bullish vs. bearish industries within each theme; the majority wins

Display mapping: "bullish" → **LEAD**, "bearish" → **LAG** (see `report_generator.py::_direction_label()`)

A LEAD theme indicates relative outperformance of its constituent industries. A LAG theme may still have positive absolute returns — it indicates relative underperformance, not a short signal.

### Known Limitations

1. **Survivorship bias**: Only analyzes currently listed stocks and ETFs
2. **Lag**: FINVIZ data may lag intraday moves by 15 minutes (public mode)
3. **Theme boundaries**: Some stocks fit multiple themes; classification uses primary industry
4. **ETF proliferation**: Catalog is static and may not capture very new ETFs
5. **Narrative scoring**: WebSearch-based and inherently subjective
6. **Public mode limitation**: ~20 stocks per industry may miss small-cap signals

### Disclaimer

**This analysis is for educational and informational purposes only.**
- Not investment advice
- Past thematic trends do not guarantee future performance
- Theme detection identifies momentum, not fundamental value
- Conduct your own research before making investment decisions

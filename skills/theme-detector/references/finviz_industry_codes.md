## Notes

1. **Filter code derivation**: Remove spaces, hyphens, ampersands (`&`), and other special characters from the industry name, then lowercase the result. Prefix with `ind_`.

2. **Cross-sector industries**: Some industries (e.g., Uranium) appear under multiple FINVIZ sectors (Energy and Basic Materials). The filter code is the same regardless of which sector view you navigate from.

3. **Industry changes**: FINVIZ occasionally adds, removes, or renames industries. This list was compiled as of February 2026. If a filter code returns no results, verify the industry name on FINVIZ directly.

4. **Combining filters**: Multiple industry filters can be combined in FINVIZ URLs using comma separation:
   ```
   f=ind_semiconductors,ind_softwareapplication,cap_smallover
   ```

5. **Market cap filter**: For theme detection, always combine with `cap_smallover` (market cap > $300M) to filter out micro-caps that may distort aggregated metrics.

6. **Special cases**:
   - "E&P" becomes "ep" (ampersand removed)
   - "REIT - " prefix becomes "reit" (hyphen and spaces removed)
   - "Wineries & Distilleries" becomes "wineriesanddistilleries" (ampersand becomes "and" in this case)
   - Verify edge cases against FINVIZ directly if results seem incorrect

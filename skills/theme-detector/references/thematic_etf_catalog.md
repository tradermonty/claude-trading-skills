# Thematic ETF Catalog

This catalog maps market themes to their associated ETFs. The ETF count per theme is used for the `etf_proliferation_score` in lifecycle maturity assessment.

**ETF Proliferation Scoring:**
| ETF Count | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| 0         | 0     |
| 1         | 20    |
| 2-3       | 40    |
| 4-6       | 60    |
| 7-10      | 80    |
| >10       | 100   |

Higher ETF proliferation indicates more retail/institutional interest and a potentially more mature (crowded) theme.
